# DH-285-Final-Project
This is my GitHub reposotory containing all of my code for my DH 285 final project! 

Contents: 

mp4_to_images.py - my python code to break up an mp4 file into images
number_of_colors.py - my test python code to find the amount of unique colors in a bunch of images
No_excel.py - *I need to change the name* this program started as a test for my number of colors program but evolved into my program to create color palettes by folder

the rest of the contents are currently for my website, which can be viewed at the link:

I plan to add my image data here in the future as well. Due to the files being too large to add here, it is proving to be a bit more difficult than I thought. Thank you for being patient!
